This tool was originally made by Ar3sgice. I tweaked it a little to make it support TrigEditPlus and EUDEditor3 types of triggers, plus various other improvements.

## Basic usage

1. Select item to edit from the left
2. Enter item ID in "object" field
3. Enter number to change in "value" field
4. Click the "v" after the value field
5. Copy the generated trigger into SCMDraft

## Advanced usage

Click the "v" beside this box to enlarge this text area

## Settings

- Use Add Value
Edit the target based on a original value.

- Trigger Style
Changes form of output triggers to match different softwares.
The ones with "condition" are for condition triggers.

- Number Format
"hex" - output hexadecimal numbers
"decimal" - output decimal
For SCMD style, memory and mask should be hex while value is decimal.

## Using different data types

- Set an address to a string
Put "string" in Value input. (must be double quotation)
Uses UTF-8 to encode the string, and adds \x00 at the end.

- Set an address to a hexadecimal string
Put 'hex' in Value input (must be single quotation)
e.g. '00 0f 20 24 4a 45 4a 43'

## Batch function

You can add multiple values in the Object and Value fields.
Separate values using commas, e.g. 3,4,5,17,18,19

For Object field, it sets every object to the same value.
For Value field, it sets each value continuously.
e.g. memory 0x10000 length 2 value 1,2,4,8
The memory from 0x10000 to 0x10008 will become 01 00 02 00 04 00 08 00

## Buttons

Don't use the buttons tab here. Use the Button Maker in the Extra Tools tab.

To use the Button Maker:
1. edit the buttons using the left and middle tab
2. click "Generate JSON" to generate JSON text
3. click "Generate Trigger" to convert JSON to triggers
4. for other parts refer to the wiki in original repository

## Requirements

Also don't use the requirements here, because it conflicts with EUD Editor 3.

## IceCC parser

It does not work because iscript cannot be modified in starcraft remastered.
It's a legacy tool for starcraft version 1.08 EUDs.

## Editing Stat_txt.tbl

1. Generate CPT triggers at the upper part (click CPT)
2. Notice there is a part saying PUT STRING EDITS HERE
3. Generate string triggers at the lower part. 2 strings at a time
4. Put the generated triggers where it said PUT STRING EDITS HERE.
5. If the trigger action count is over 64, put the last trigger in Trigger Slicer.
