## Basic usage

1. Select item to edit from the left
2. Enter item ID in "object" field
3. Enter number to change in "value" field
4. Click the "v" after the value field
5. Copy the generated trigger into SCMDraft

## Update v2.0

1. Added object selection box

Press Shift+Click to add units, Alt+Click to remove units.
It can batch generate for several units at one time

If the generated triggers become too many, use the
"Trigger Slicer" to help (chops triggers into 64-size blocks
for SCMD, or use If/DoActions for EUD3)

2. Added most of the supported addresses from EUDDB
3. Added memory info (from EUDDB, hover to read)
4. Fully revamped UI with Space Platform background style
5. Mobile viewport support (probably unnecessary)

## Settings

- Use Add Value
Edit the target based on a original value.

- Trigger Style
SCMDraft = SCMDraft triggers
TrigEditPlus = TEP triggers (need support EUDX)
EUDEditor3 = EPScript Triggers

- Number Format
"hex" - output hexadecimal numbers
"decimal" - output decimal
For SCMD style, memory and mask should be hex while value is decimal

- Reverse calculate object
Calculates object number if input on the memory field
Only supports single value

## Using different data types

- Set object or value to an array
Separate values using comma
e.g. 1, 10, 100, 101, 102

- Set an address to a string
Put "string" in Value input. (must be double quotation)
Uses UTF-8 to encode the string, and adds \x00 at the end.
Supports SCMD color tags.
e.g. "<10>H<4>ello <10>W<4>orld"

- Set an address to a hexadecimal string
Put 'hex' in Value input (must be single quotation)
e.g. '00 0f 20 24 4a 45 4a 43'

## Batch function

You can add multiple values in the Object and Value fields.
Separate values using commas, e.g. 3,4,5,17,18,19

For Object field, it sets every object to the same value.
For Value field, it sets each value continuously.
e.g. memory 0x10000 length 2 value 1,2,4,8
The memory from 0x10000 to 0x10008 will become 01 00 02 00 04 00 08 00

## Buttons

DO NOT use the buttons tab here
Use the Button Maker in the "Extra Tools" section.

To use the Button Maker:
1. edit the buttons using the left and middle tab
2. click "Generate JSON" to generate JSON text
3. click "Generate Trigger" to convert JSON to triggers
4. for other parts refer to the wiki in original repository

## Requirements

Also don't use the requirements here, because it conflicts with EUD Editor 3.

## IceCC parser

It does not work because iscript cannot be modified in starcraft remastered.
It's a legacy tool for starcraft version 1.08 EUDs.

## Editing Stat_txt.tbl

I have upgraded this tool to use fixed address since SC:R string address
seems fixed to 0x19184660.
To add condition in batch generation add line
cond=Switch("start", Set);
