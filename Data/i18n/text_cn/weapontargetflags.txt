This is actually better thought of "which units can this weapon deal damage to". Eg if you give a ground weapon the air + ground target as well as splash, then when it attacks a ground unit, any air units in the vicinity will also take splash damage. If you also set it to have Mechanical targeting, then the weapon will be able to attack all types of ground units, but only deal damage to ones with the mechanical flag.
